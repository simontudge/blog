# Personal travel blog

Visit the sight [here](https://simontudge.github.io/travel-blog/).

The sight is written in custom html, rather than using a framework, but uses some of the bootstrap templating as a starting point.

Each entry is usually one country, but it doesn't have to be. The homepage has a list of panels, one for each post, which are clicked on to link to the actual post, rather than a continous blog stream. See the templates folder for adding a new panel and a blog post.

        <p class="lead">I’ve finished my 9 month long break from work and have moved to the Netherlands. For the moment my travelling is more of the short holiday variety. Here I talk about a very interesting ten day dipping of my toe into the promised land: Israel.</p>

        <p>
It's hard to say where the mythology of Israel's origins begin and the real stuff starts. It's possible to take an extremely deep breath and begin at God forming the first man from the dust on the temple mount and arrive at Churchill carving up the middle east and not quite know where the myth ended and the reality begins. The country and the history have a surreal air to them. The stories are too real and the reality is too bizarre to make sense of this place. The bible tells us that the jews were enslaved in Egypt, Moses lead them to the promised land; thier they set up shop, then, as now, with fairly little regard for the people that were already living there. God (or later the British) had given them this land, it was promised to them and that was that. We don't really know if this is true, or if the Jews were ever really enslaved in Egypt. Perhaps this was the founding mythology of the Jedaens, a story concocted to justify their ownership of the place, but then on the other hand much of what the bible tells us has some basis in reality; there really was a king David, there really was a battle in Jericho, and a failed invasion by the Assyrians, so maybe the business with Moses and the Pharaoh really did happen, and that where the history of the Jews in this part of the world began.</p>

<p>My journey began in a misty Dutch morning in March, an Arab taxi driver scoffing that I was going to Tel-Aviv, and a special area of Amsterdam airport with extra guns and an overly zealous Israel imegration officer (are you a te-r-r-r-orist, have you eve-r-r-r been to I-r-r-r-aq, I-r-r-r-an or [the best one for the guttural hebrew r] Sy-r-r-r-ia) were the perfect framing for my trip to Israel. The fog was so thick that I could barely see the plane as I boarded it, and presumably the pilot also couldn't see the runaway from the cockpit. The plane sat on the runway for two hours before we could set off, over Germany, Turkey and across the mediterianian to the little Jewish enclave in a sea of Arab, which we call Israel. More absurd questions from the border patrol, "a-r-r-r-e you f-r-r-r-iends with any a-r-r-r-abs?" I wonder how many people have broken down under this questions 'I'm here to join Hamas and marter myself by blowing up an IDF soldier'. I managed not to crack under Mossad (not Mossad's) questions, and they decide to let me in. Hello Israel, I'm here, who are you? What are you up to? What are you dreams and dark secrets? I doubt that I'll find out in the nine days that I'm here, but I can but try.</p>

<p>The 2 hour delay to the flight means that the sun has already set. Not an issue except that it's Friday, which means the Shabbat. The buses and the trains have stopped, which means a taxi. As all stingy travellers surely know: a taxi from an airport is a last resort, but there is no other way to get to Tel-Aviv. I buddy up with a couple of German (of course) backpackers, to split the extortionate fair, and we make it to Tel-Aviv. Our taxi driver is a Russian Israeali, one of many who moved here after the fall of the Soviet Union, much more comfortable in Russian than Hebrew. I could probe more, but it's late and his English is stilted, so we pass much of the journey in silence.</p>

<p>My first impression of Tel-Aviv is that it has the outward trappings of any middle-eastern city; it's all concrete and dust. Shaddy winding alleyways smelling of piss and offal. But something is distinctly different; and it's the people. It's not that they are Jewish sets them apart from their Arab neighbours; its something more profound than that, they are hipsters!</p>

<p>For a country that bleeds history from every unassuming orifice, Tel-Aviv lacks an ancient past. It was a centre of early zionist emmegration when the state of Israel was but a twinkle in Balfour's eye. The adjacent town of Jaffa is mentioned in both Greek mythology, and in the bible, but Tel-Aviv itself is a modern steel and concrete construction.</p>

<p>I check into the hostel. Along with the usual German and American clientele, in the room across from me three Israeli teenagers are enjoying a week of partying before enrolling on their compulsory military service of three years. A beer in the war mediterinian air and to bed after a long day of travel.</p>

<p>The next day I find a bicycle shop. Well not exactly a shop, but a few bikes chained to a railing in a square with instructions to send a whatsapp message to the owners; send them some money via paypal, and they will send you the codes for the bikes. Very trusting on both ends; but I get the code and the bike unlocks and is mine for the day. The city even has cycle lanes, something unthinkable for most cities in the middle east.</p>

<p>I take my bike down to the beach. Today is the shabbat (i.e. day of rest), there are many locals strolling on the beach using various hipster forms of transport, including the ubiquitous electric scooter. I still can't really believe this place; think Amman meets San Francisco. I don't have too much of an aim today, except to explore the main districts of Tel-Aviv: Flortenin, one of the epicentres of hipster Tel-Aviv, Neve-Tedek, one of the first places where the early zionist came to live in number, which is almost empty on a Saturday, and the lively Rothschild bolevard, a beacon of life on this sleepy day.</p>

<p>From there I go to the big outdoor swimming pool; namely Gordan pool, a 50m outdoor salt water pool. Only the hardcores older locals are here, it's still March, and not yet that warm. Still I take a long refreshing swim, and get some energy to explore more.</p>

<p>Next stop is the Modern-Art gallery, an avant-garde structure of angular steel and glass. The contemporary exhibits are well over my head, obviously I'm too much of a philistine to understand, but the permanent exhibit is well worth a look, a few picassos, Dalis etc. and some interesting stuff from the locals.</p>

<p>Back to the hostel with a stop for some hummus on the way. I meet a few people in the hostel and we go to a bar. It's mostly for tourists; I'm surrounded by young American backpackers, and I feel quite out of place, so I don't stay for too long.</p>

<p>The next day I head into the old town of Jaffa. Jaffa existed long before Tel-Aviv. Much of the architecture that survives is Ottoman in its nature. I take one of the free tours (although not really free as you are expected to tip). Our tour guide, Ben, tells us that the old town is now composed roughly equally of Arab-Christians, Arab-Muslims and Jews, who rub along, we are told somewhat pointedly, quite nicely.</p>

<p>This town, and the surrounding hills, were once famous for their eponymous oranges. When the british came here they were producing so many oranges that they had to make up more and more ways to use siad oranges, from whence the famous jaffa cake, just one of the many gifts that this land has given us. On our way we sea a small sculpture situated in the narrow ottoman streets: a jaffa orange tree hanging dislocated from the ground, suspended from the nearby buildings. Perhaps signifying, our tour guide tells us, how the modern Israelis are detached from the land they live on. Now land in Tel-Aviv is so expensive that no-one actually grows jaffa oranges here anymore, even the ones that you can buy on the local souques are probably grown in Africa. Tech start-ups are now more profitable than citrus fruits.</p>

<p>As well as oranges one of this land's most famous exports is Christianity. In the old town stands St. Peter's church, which was, our guide tells us, where a life changing decision was made. Around the year 70 ad into one of the local tanning shops wondered a man by the name of Peter, later St. Peter, and symbolic ancestor to all future Popes. In this smelly leather workshop Peter had a vision, in which angels threw animals at him, compelling him to eat. One of these animals was a pig, which was definitely not kosher to the good Jewish man Peter. 'Oh I've changed my mind, you can eat these now, and more or less anything you want', said God, through the mouthpiece of the Angels. Peter had carte blanche to export Christianity to the goyim, and had taken the first step away from a Jewish sect to a religion in its own right. So, if you are a christian you can thank this man for your bacon sandwich, and possibly the fold of skin at the end of your penis (if you are lucky enough to have one). Jewah had made the shrewd political compromise at exactly the right moment it seems, and Christianity gradually spread to the Roman empire, thanks in part to St Peter's revelation; indeed a shrewd piece of rebranding from the omnipotent creator of all things in retrospect. The tanners where Peter had his pork based revelation is now a pretty church on a hill overlooking the Meditarrenean, and a place of pilgrimage for bacon loving goy such as myself. Thank you St Peter.</p>

<p>After the tour I head back to the hostel through the various districts of Tel-Aviv, much more lively now that it's Sunday, and to a market. A delicious kebab, and a Libian man sells me some pancakes, wrapped in a napkin sporting Gadaffi's face. I pick up my bag and head to Jerusalem. A short ride, but a giant cultural leap from Tel-Aviv.</p>

<p>After the jews had taken the holy land, as God promised them, they started building Jerusalem and the first temple on the temple-mount. The twelve tribes of the Jews split into the kingdom of Judea in the South, and the smaller Israel in the North. The Judeans decided to create a king, the most famous of which, David, founded his capital in Jerusalem, and began to build the first temple on mount Zion.</p>

<p>Clearly God had second thoughts about giving the Jews their promised land, as he sent the Babyloneans to invade, they won, and they destroyed the first temple, and the Jews went into exile. During their exile in Babylon the jews put their finishing touches to the first five chapters of the bible. Judaism took on its (roughly) modern form, asserting that there is only one God (some historians argue that Judaism had worshiped Yahweh exclusively, but believed that there were other Gods in addition to Him). The might have been the end of it; how many people have been invaded, slaughtered or assimilated into more powerful empires. Except that the jews were different. They kept their identity; judaism became less centred on a holy place, but on holy texts and customs, allowing the jews to keep their religion alive even as a displaced minority.</p>

<p>The jews exile did not last long, as the Persian invaded the Babilonian empire they allowed the Jews to return to their holy land. The jews began to rebuild the temple, culminating in the work of the meglomanically king Herod, jewish vassel to the Romans. He began to build in a big way, probably destroying the temple that stood on the temple mount. Those who have been paying attention will, at this point, realise that if he did destroy the temple here the one he built would in fact be the third temple, however, for some reason, Herod's marble monster carries the moinker of “the second temple” to this day.</p>

<p>The first thing that one notices upon entering Jerusalem is that the people look very different from those in Tel-Aviv. If you were to close your eyes and imagine a Jewish person, unless you are very PC, they might look like the kind of person you would see in Jerusalem. The men with tight black curls, poking out from under a dark black hats. The women modestly dressed, with ankle length skirts, a world away from the beautifully tanned flesh on display in Tel-Aviv.</p>

<p>I find my hostel, and it is already getting dark, but I begin to explore the old town of Jerusalem. The hostel is a short walk from, but outside of, the old town, and the main entrance to the old town is through the Jaffa gate. Funnily enough the first thing I see when I enter is a money changer. (I didn't kick them out and found a religion in case you were wondering).</p>

<p>The old town, usually overrun with tourists, is incredibly quiet at night, and it is quite a magical experience wondering these streets in quiet darkness alone. The western (or wailing wall) is one of the only sights that is open in the evening. After the Romans crushed the jewish rebellion (around 70 ad) they destroyed the second temple. Now all that remains of Herod's creation is the western wall of the old temple. This is one of the holiest sites in Judaism now, and conservative jews still come here to pray against the wall. Men to the left, and women to the (much smaller) section on the right. I'm able to go right upto the wall and the praying jews seem to completely ignore my presence. There is a slightly voyeuristic feel to watching these people pray, like David Attenbourough narrating the mating turtles. Except that instead of a rutting turtle I'm watching a Hysidic man banging his head against a 2000 year limestone wall. Surreal to say the least, and that's it for the first day of exploring Jerusalem.</p>

<p>The next day I spend on the free tour of the old city, through the various quarters of the old town. One of the quarters belongs to the Armenians. The Armenians were one of the first empires to officially adopt Christianity, the early Christian pilgrims needed patronage and protection in their holy city, to whit the Armenians were granted control of one of the quarters of Jerusalem, hence the name. The Armeninan quarter is home to the church of the holy sepulchre, filled to bursting with Christian pilgrims, many from Orthodox eastern europe, every bit as fanatical as the jews banging their head against the wailing wall. This is where Jesus is supposedly (not) buried, as of course an actual corpse would give the game away. The myriad Christian sects, finding the sectarian tension with the jews and the Muslims not quite fulfilling enough, are in constant squabble with each other. The solution is that the keys to the church actually belong to a local muslim family, and every inch of the holy sight is carefully divided between the various denominations, a state of affairs known as the 'status-quo'. The monks must adhere to the strict demarcation of the various zones of the church with pedantic devotion. A good piece of trivia: look up from the main entrance to the windows above, and you'll see an orphaned ladder sitting abandoned on the sill. The status-quo forgot to mention this window sill, and one of the workers left a ladder there between the windows of two of the sects (I forget which). Neither set of monks dare to fetch the ladder for disturbing the delicate peace, so it sits there uncared for to this day.</p>

<p>Our tour takes us to a small hill with a view of the dome of the rock. The muslim Waqf still controls the mosque and the shrine on what the jews call the temple mount, but the muslims call Haram al-sharif. The koran documents the night journey of Mohamed to 'al-aqsa' (the far sanctuary), where he finally ascends to heaven, meeting the patriarchs, culminating in Abraham, and finally the mighty Allah himself at the highest tier of heaven. After some back and forth between Muhamed and Allah they agree on the final rules for humanity to live by, and God declares, conveniently for Muhammed and his followers, that this is his final word on the matter, there are to be no more revelations. Although the Koran doesn't actually name check Jerusalem itself, saying simply the farthest place, Jerusalem was at the edge of the Mohammedan empire at the time of writing, and already a place of great importance to the Abrahamic religions, so it was generally taken as read that the “far-place” was here on the temple mount. The muslims still control the haram al-sharif, despite the fact that Israel controls the security leading up to the temple mount. Non-muslims are not allowed inside the dome, and the nearby al-aqsa mosque, but they are allowed to approach them and see them from the outside. Alas, I never quite managed to arrive here at the right time, so this far glimpse of the golden dome is as close as I ever got, a reason to come back perhaps.</p>

<p>We snake through the other quarters of the old city, the arab quarter being the most striking, it being immediately apparent that something has changed as you enter the tight streets and explore the shiny goods on display in the many souques; it’s like being in Morocco, except with 3G. In many cities people congregate by race or religion, but here it is that much more obvious, and that much more codified. There is sharp line where Jewdiasm gives way to Islam. The people tolerate each other, for the most part, but they also live in completely separate worlds.</p>

<p>The tour ends and I explore a little bit more by myself, and then out of the old town to a charming market called 'Mahane Yehuda' and sample a delicious malawach, a Yemani pancake brought to Israel by the Yemeni jews.</p>

<p>The heavens open, and I'm completely unprepared, my assumption having been that the meditareane middle east would be unending sunshine, and I'm forced to retreat to the hostel for the night.</p>

<p>The next day is an early start, as I booked a day tour down the dead sea cost, to the Roman fortress of Masada, a trip to an Oasis, and a dip in the Dead Sea. Our driver is Kurdish jew whos family hails from Iraq, but was born here. I'm struck by this inherent tension between Israel nationalism and the myriad different ethnicities that in reality exist within Judaism. I'm told that there is an inherent hierarchy within Israel, even within the jews. First come those who hail from the western world, such as Britain and America, then come the ashkenazi and the sephardic (Spanish)  jews, who are themselves divided between those who were wise enough to have left Europe before the holocaust, and those who, to their great chargrin, were not. Then come the Arab jews, not quite as bad as being an arab muslim, I’m told, but still Arab nonetheless. Finally, there are black jews, who hail from Ethiopia, not quite as bad as being a muslim, but somewhat of an underclass. I cannot tell whether there is real truth in this, but our bus driver thinks so, and he wastes no time in letting us know his feelings, from the perspective of a Kurd, who are from an outside view essentially Arab (a charge which they vehemently deny). I am becoming side tracked, we are on our way to Massadda, past Bethlehem (where god was born) and Jericho (where X brought down the walls by blowing his trumpet) and towards the Dead Sea, which lies below actual sea level.</p>

<p>The cool(ish) March air becomes decidedly thicker and warmer as we descend below the level of the ocean and towards the receding banks of the Dead Sea. The Sea has been getting smaller and smaller, more and more the term sea seems like a mocking pecorative; maybe one day we will own up and call it what it now is: a salty puddle. We pass hotels that would have once been sea-front, but now back onto an elongated squelch of mud that eventually, some 500 meters later dribbles into the water.</p>

<p>Enough of that, we pull into the carpark of Masada. A roman fortress built on a dramatic promontory of rock. As the roman Empire began to flex its sizable muscles, but before it had expanded explicitly into this region the Jewish king Herod (most famous for his attempts to kill our lord the word unto flesh, in his nascent form) agreed to become the client (or one might less charitably say, bitch) of the Roman empire, thus the Romans had begun their conquest of this land. The king, with his new found wealth and impunity, began to build on a big scale, including this rather fetching fortress in the middle of the Judaen desert, now adorned with a steel cable car, so that you need not go through the hardship of the hour long walk to the top. In the year 70AD the Romans has well and truly set up shop here. So much so that they demanded that the jews kept the image of the emperor in the temple mount. The Romans, with a few notable exceptions, were tolerant of the religions of the savages whom they subjugated, but there were limits, and of course all of their subjects must pay the Romans the due fealty. Judaism, being somewhat more of an uncompromising religion, didn’t see the Roman’s point of view, and they stormed the city and the surrounding areas, and claimed ownership once more of an area that we now, roughly, call Israel. The mad Emperor Nero was more than a little put out by these turn of events, and so sent his trusty general and one day successor, Titus to clean up the mess. The Jewish rebel, to their credit, put up a pretty credible fight, but in the end they were no match for the formidable Roman war machine and were crushed. Although the gentle Roman general no doubt wanted to slap the wrists of the rebels and send them on their way, an example had to be set, so he began to systematically destroy the architecture and culture of Judaism, nailing a few thousand of them to trees, in inimitable Roman style, for good measure. The scattered Jewish people fled to the known corners of the ancient world, their dreams of jedo-nationalism dealt a near fatal blow, but never quit relinquished. They would have to wait for nearly two millennia for that silently nurtured dream to awake from its millennial slumber. A hard core of rebels, who would rather die than give in to Roman rule, better nailed to a Roman cross, than scrubbing a Roman’s floor and worshiping his gods, fled to Herrod’s fortress overlooking the Dead Sea. Again we meet with this theme that lives in this land, here is a group of men with an idea, a belief or conviction that is so strong that it is either complete and utter adherence to the cause, or it is death. They choose the latter, and I don’t know whether to admire them. Whatever the answer these brave (or foolish) souls held out against the mighty Romans in their hill-top fortress for 3 long years. The Romans could well have left them there, but the delicate pride of the Roman empire could not stand the slight on its dignity, so instead began to build an enormous ramp up onto the hill top so they could storm the fortress. The remnants of this can still be seen now (it’s enormous). Looking down onto the plain you can still make out the massive impressions of the two roman garrisons that lay siege to Masada. As they entered the fortress they expected a fight, but were met with silence. Joshephus, a jewish historian, who had jumped sides and was documenting the campaign from within the Roman ranks, said this:</p>

<p>They then chose ten men by lot out of them, to slay all the rest; every one of whom laid himself down by his wife and children on the ground, and threw his arms about them, and they offered their necks to the stroke of those who by lot executed that melancholy office; (396) and when these ten had, without fear, slain them all, they made the same rule for casting lots for themselves, that he whose lot it was should first kill the other nine, and after all, should kill himself. Accordingly, all these had courage sufficient to be no way behind one another in doing or suffering; (397) so, for a conclusion, the nine offered their necks to the executioner, and he who was the last of all took a view of all the other bodies, lest perchance some or other among so many that were slain should want his assistance to be quite dispatched; and when he perceived that they were all slain, he set fire to the palace, and with the great force of his hands ran his sword entirely through himself, and fell down dead near to his own relations. (398).</p>

<p>In short they killed themselves, rather than submit to Roman rule.</p>

<p>Another quote from Salman Rushdie sums up the obstinate refusal to compromise:</p>

<p>“What kind of idea are you? Are you the kind that compromises, does deals, accommodates itself to society, aims to find a niche, to survive; or are you the cussed, bloody-minded, ramrod-backed type of damnfool notion that would rather break than sway with the breeze? – The kind that will almost certainly, ninety-nine times out of a hundred, be smashed to bits; but, the hundredth time, will change the world.”
Juwdaism is that one idea in a hundred; despite the efforts of many it is still here, long after the Roman empire has crumbled into dust.</p>

<p>The morning air is still, just about, bearable, so I take the snake path to the summit, somewhat more arduous than the cable car, but considerably less so than spending three years building a ramp, and admire the sweeping views of the Dead Sea and the historically drenched desert. A beautiful place, and a highlight of the tour.</p>

<p>Our second stop of the day long tour is Ein Gedhi, a small oasis in the Jewdaen desert. Very much a beautiful stop, but ruined somewhat by the tacky touristifaction of the spot. We’ve to pay to enter, and follow a single path up to the top. Upon passing the turnstiles it’s more or less one long queue to get to the top, so busy with tourists, like ourselves, is this particular spot. I can take or leave this kind of thing. Likewise our last stop on the Dead Sea itself. In my imagination a dip in the Dead Sea is quite appealing, but in reality the overfarming and damming of the rivers has led this once magnificent sea to receive significantly. Meaning the changing rooms that were once by the waterfront lie a 500 meter soggy trample to the murky water. The “beach” is full with Russians on package holidays. I hate to generalise about an entire nationality, but beaches full of Russians make my stomach turn. It’s slightly too cold to float in the water, but too salty to really swim. I do the mandatory rubbing of mud into my body; rather dubiously said to have miscellaneous and unspecified healing properties; and head back early to the car park for an overpriced instant coffee.</p>

<p>The trip to Masada was breathtaking, and for this alone the tour was worth it, but I could take or leave the other two excursions. Once again I’m done for the day, and head back to the hostel.</p>

<p>Now I’m at a crossroads in my travel. I don’t quite have time to do everything that I wanted to do, explore the north of the country, beautiful towns and mountains; hike in the desert, or be a brave explorer and head into the west-bank. Browsing the website of the tour group that I had used that day I see a once a week tour into the west-bank, by the name of “dual narrative tour”, in which the lucky tourist is treated to the opions of one muslim palesinian, and one zionist jew as he makes his way around the delights of the west-bank, presumably all the while trying to stop his two tour guides from killing each other. As luck would have it, the tour goes only once a week, but is running the very next day: sounds a blast, so I eagerly sign up and hit the hay in anticipation of another early start.</p>

<p>The start is indeed early. In the morning dawn light we are met by our first tour guide, elliom, a conservative jew, with the attire to go with it, who has spent some time in the US. He is to take us, via public transport, to the town of Hebron. To those who follow the wrinkles of the israel-palestine conflict Hebron is the disneyland of religo-ethnic conflict in the region. Much like a Derry/London-Derry of the middle east, but with better humus.</p>

<p>I’m predisposed towards antipathy towards such a man as Eliom, but his bumbling charm is hard to dislike. He is clearly opinionated, but is able to present both sides of the debate with some dispassion. I like the guy. He takes us on a number of forms of transport, first an electric tram, then a 500 tonne armoured bus [I may have made this number up] towards hebron. The bus is built like a tank incase of unsolicited homemade incendiary devices that might find their way through the glass and onto our unsuspecting laps. We are told, as way of reassurance, that such an attack has not happened in quite some time, what exactly ‘quite some time’ means is not clarified, but Eliom, in traditional Jewish garb, seem relaxed, and so then are we. As we chop between modes of transportation we are told regaled by history and personal anecdote.</p>

<p>The jews and the Arabs of the regions will certainly try to kidnap you, he says and pauses dramatically, kidnap you opinions that is! The jews and the Arabs, he continues, are embroiled in some form of victimology poker.</p>

<p>BE SURE TO MENTION THE SHIPPING CONTAINER.</p>

<p>Dual narrative,</p>

<p>Vad Yasham</p>

<p>Bus to Bethlehem, banksy hotel and the tour of the wall and the refugee camp.</p>

<p>To Haifa and an end to travelling.</p>
